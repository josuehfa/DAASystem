/**
 * This reads in and stores a set of aircraft states, possibly over time, (and parameters) from a file
 * The Aircraft states are stored in an ArrayList&lt;AircraftState&gt;.<p>
 * 
 * This can read state/history files as well as sequence files (slight variations on history files).<p>
 *
 * State files consist of comma or space-separated values, with one point per line.
 * Required columns include aircraft name, 3 position columns (either x[nmi]/y[nmi]/z[ft] or latitude[deg]/longitude[deg]/altitude[ft]) and
 * 3 velocity columns (either vx[kn]/vy[kn]/vz[fpm] or track[deg]/gs[kn]/vs[fpm]).<p>
 *
 * An optional column is time [s].  If it is included, a "history" will be build if an aircraft has more than one entry.
 * If it is not included, only the last entry for an aircraft will be stored.<p>
 *
 * It is necessary to include a header line that defines the column ordering.  The column definitions are not case sensitive.
 * There is also an optional header line, immediately following the column definition, that defines the unit type for each
 * column (the defaults are listed above).<p>
 *
 * If points are consecutive for the same aircraft, subsequent name fields may be replaced with a double quotation mark (&quot;).
 * The aircraft name is case sensitive, so US54A != Us54a != us54a.<p>
 *
 * Any empty line or any line starting with a hash sign (#) is ignored.<p>
 *
 * Files may also include parameter definitions prior to other data.  Parameter definitions are of the form &lt;key&gt; = &lt;value&gt;,
 * one per line, where &lt;key&gt; is a case-insensitive alphanumeric word and &lt;value&gt; is either a numeral or string.  The &lt;value&gt;
 * may include a unit, such as <tt>dist = 50 [m]</tt>.  Note that parameters require a space on either side of the equals sign.
 * Note that it is possible to also update the stored parameter values (or store additional ones) through API calls.<p>
 *
 * Parameters can be interpreted as double values, strings, or Boolean values, and the user is required to know which parameter is
 * interpreted as which type.<p>
 * 
 * If the optional parameter <tt>filetype</tt> is specified, its value must be <tt>state</tt>, <tt>history</tt>, or <tt>sequence</tt> for this reader
 * to accept the file without error.<p>
